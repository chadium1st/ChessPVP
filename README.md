# ChessPVP by chadium1st.

- Created a chess game using the pygame library with several os modules.
- Used object oriented approach with several classes and user-defined modules that are interconnected.
- No Enpassante yet, but I'm working on it.
- Defined the rules of the game, and moves of the pieces myself rather than using the chess libraries available.
